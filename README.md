### Development Process

I started by mapping out what I wanted each user post to look like. I decided that each post would include a date, match, underdog odds, and feedback(comments). Once I completed the post schema and the routes associated with it. I then made a subdoc for comments and the route so users can leave feedback on the posts.

Once I had my back end working, I started building my front end, adding API calls for posts and comments. Once the CRUD actions on my front end was working, I incorporated handlbars to index the posts.

### Future Iterations:
The styling needs more work as I am still figuring out bootstrap and the use of handlebars. I would like to create a button that would view the comments on the post when clicked. Also, adding a thumb up/thumbs down feature would be ideal.
